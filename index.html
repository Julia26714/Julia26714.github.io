  Guess I got what I deserved
Kept you waiting there too long, my love
All that time, without a word
Did you really think that I'd forget
And regret
The special love I have for you
My baby blue
All those days became so long
Did you really think I'd do you wrong?
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize I would know
I would show
The special love I have for you
My baby blue
What can I do? What can I say?
Except I want you by my side
How can I show you? Show me the way
Don't you know the times I've tried?
Guess that's all I have to say
Except the feeling just grows stronger everyday
Just one thing before I go
Take good care, baby, let me know
Let it grow
The special love you have for me
My Dixie dear
